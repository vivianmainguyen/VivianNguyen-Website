        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Vivian Mai Nguyen, but some refer to me as “that girl in Key Club.” Although Key Club played an extreme role in my high school career, there is a lot more to me than that! I also volunteer as a peer tutor at our school, and I’m a proud member of our school’s National Honor Society! I love volunteering, clearly, but I also really enjoy art, photography, nature, and music. I hope one day that I am able to create designs that people really enjoy. Whether it’s through clothing or game design, I really want to make my artwork known to the world. Whenever school stresses me out, I can rely on music to make my day a lot better! Although I only play one instrument, music is somewhat of an emotional outlet for me, and I appreciate music so so much. After high school, I hope to pursue a degree in Computational Mathematics at the University of California Riverside. Hopefully I am able to get a job in software development and make my parents proud!<br><br>

        I’ve spent all of my high school career devoting my time into Key Club, an organization that has significantly changed my life. There are so many amazing leaders in Key Club, and I can proudly say that I am one of those leaders. I served as an officer for Key Club for three years, holding four different positions at varying levels. Through my work I was able to guide members on their Key Club journey by providing them with the opportunities to make a difference in our community. Although the primary focus of Key Club is service, I felt like it was important to create a bond with our members as well. I always encourage my members to talk to me, even about things other than Key Club because I want to show them that we care for our members. I’ve developed such a deep bond with many of the members of our club, and I know they can rely on me to help them in anyway I can.
        Not only do I help members on an emotional level, I’ve also provided all my publications and artwork into Key Club that will be utilized for years to come. I created newsletters and infographics that detail the many ways Key Clubbers can make a difference in the world. For example, I have a publication detailing the many ways we can keep our cities clean, such as hosting a beach cleanup at your local beach, or having a cleanup event at your school. I know that many clubs have benefited from the publications I created, and I hope that I left a lasting impact on my division.
<br><br>

        I also have experience as an IT intern for Boeing in Huntington Beach. I spent 8 weeks of my summer working on programs, managing equipment, and ordering supplies for my building. I also learned many different types of coding languages. Through this internship I was able to gauge the different fields of engineering while also specializing in a field I'm interested in.
